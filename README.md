## Winner

The winner of the superbowl is the winner of the Fury Madden Challenge.

## Superbowl

There is one superbowl. The participants will compete with the teams that make the NFL superbowl. The winner of the conference championships will choose the team in the superbowl.

## Conference championships

There are two conference championships, AFC and NFC. In each conference championship, the participants will compete with the teams that make it to each NFL conference championship. The winner of the regular season gets to choose the teams for both games. The winner of the conference championship is determined by the following process.

1. If one participant wins both games, that participant is the winner.

2. If each participant wins one game, the participant with the most total points in both games is the winner.

3. If each participant wins one game and the total points in both games are tied, the winner of the final regular season game (or regular-season tie-breaker if applicable) is the winner.

## Regular season

There will be 18 regular season games. The participants will compete with teams that play each other in the NFL each week. For each regular season game except the first, the winner of the previous week will pick the matchup. The loser will pick the team. For the first game, the loser of the previous year picks the matchup and the winner picks the team. The same teams may not be chosen in back-to-back weeks. The winner of the regular season is determined by the following process.

1. If one participant has more wins, that participant is the winner.

2. If both participants have 9 wins, the participant with the most points scored throughout the regular season is the winner.

3. If both participants have 9 wins and the points scored throughout the season is tied, there will be a tie-breaker game between the two teams in the NFL with the worst record during their regular season. The winner of the last game of the regular season picks the team. The other participant gets home-field advantage.
